  <h2>🚀 Project Management – Launch of a New Salesforce-Based Product Offering (Media-Cadeau)</h2>

  <h3>📚 Context</h3>
  <p>
    Following the acquisition of Glady by Sodexo, the Media-Cadeau teams from Sodexo had to migrate to Glady's Salesforce platform. This required a comprehensive review of their processes and a careful transition, adapting them to our tools and workflows.
